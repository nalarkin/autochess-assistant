"""
This program keeps track of suggests team comps and keeps track of user
pieces they input. Then it displays the units they need to buy to complete
composition.
"""

"""
Workflow:

- user enters units they currently have
- program suggests comps
- user selects comp
- program prints full comp
- program prints the pieces they need to complete comp
- user updates pieces they have
- program retrieves new list of pieces to print
